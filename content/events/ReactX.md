## What is React?

React is an open-source and client-side JavaScript library which is
maintained by Facebook and is used for building complex single page
applications.

React allows for state to be bundled together with the components, which
enables developers to build declarative apps.

## Goals

In this workshop weâ€™ll be building a simple escape room game. The
following concepts will be used in building the game:

-   JavaScript Basics
-   Setting up the React development environment
-   Class & Functional components
-   `useState` Hook that lets you use React state with functional components
-   Event Handling in React
-   Some interesting mouse pointer listeners

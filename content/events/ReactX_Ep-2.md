## What is React?

React is an open-source and client-side JavaScript library which is
maintained by Facebook and is used for building complex single page
applications.

React allows for state to be bundled together with the components, which
enables developers to build declarative apps.

## What is NodeJS?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript
runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes
JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## Goals

In this workshop we’ll be building a simple Job Portal. The
following concepts will be used in building the Job Portal:

- API Basics
- Navigation and Routing SPA
- AJAX calls to Service calls
- Implementation of Sign Up + Sign In + Sign Out Functionalities
